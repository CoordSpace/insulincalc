# Insulin Unit Calculator
A simple mobile-focused web interface for calculating short-acting insulin doses in accordance with basal-bolus insulin dosing equations as defined in the research articles and worksheets sourced below.

# <strong> WARNING </strong>

Although this app is using a widely-known, simple, and oft-used equation to calculate insulin dosages, this app was in no way developed under the active-guidance of a medical professional. I (Chris Earley) have tested the app under numerous conditions but I will in no way be responsible for any negative health effects this app may cause.

This app was created as a tool for guidance but the user's better judgement should be utilized during every use. If a dosage amount seems low/high, double-check it using the official [Insulin Correction Dose Calculator](http://perinatology.com/calculators/Insulin%20Correction%20Dose.htm) from perinatology.com and/or talk with your physician. If any odd-business occurs, please send in a bug request or tweet me at [@coordspace](https://twitter.com/coordspace) on twitter.

Lastly, it's a good habit to be skeptical of any numbers that are presented by <strong>any and all</strong> medical apps/devices. After all, this is your health we're talking about and machines are not infallible.

## How to use

#### Setup
Upon loading the page, you must fill out the fields in the settings section of the interface and press the update button. The values needed should be provided to you by your physician or other relevant healthcare professional.

Upon updating, the values are now stored in a browser cookie and should persist between app uses as long as the cookie remains. You can also update the settings values at any time to match your current health situation.

#### Calculating

With the settings constants filled out, you can now return to the top of the page and fill in your current info and press calculate. The current blood sugar and carbs in next meal values are the only things that you'll need to input with each use of the calculator.

#### Results

Located below the calculate button is the results table showing the total short-acting insulin units you need for your next meal. Displayed is the raw decimal value and a value that has been rounded to the nearest 0.5 units.


## Equations

The calculator uses the basal-bolus insulin dosing equation outlined in the Analysis of Guidelines for Basal-Bolus Insulin Dosing whitepaper.<sup>1 (Eq. 1, 2)</sup> This equation is a "widely used method of care for persons with diabetes" that "pertains to both insulin pump therapy and multiple-dose insulin injection therapy." This equation is also mentioned in numerous worksheets<sup>2</sup> and patient training literature.<sup>3</sup>

The steps needed to calculate a patient's insulin units before a meal are in two parts.

First the total grams of carbohydrates in the upcoming meal and the physician-specified insulin-to-carb ratio are used to calculate the units of insulin needed for food.

![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%20Insulin%5C%20Dose_%7B%28food%29%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BCarbs%5C%20in%5C%20Next%5C%20Meal%7D%7BInsulin%5C%20to%5C%20Carb%5C%20Ratio%7D&bc=white&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)

Then the patient's current blood sugar levels, target blood sugar, and physician-specified correction factor are used to calculate the correction units of insulin needed to reach their target blood sugar.

![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=Insulin\%20Dose_{%28Correction%29}%20%3D%20\frac{Current\%20Blood\%20Sugar\%20-\%20Target\%20Blood\%20Sugar}{Correction\%20Factor}&bc=white&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)

With those two values known, they are summed together to yield the total amount of insulin dosing units needed.
